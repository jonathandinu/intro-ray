## Overview

Artificial intelligence applications are more widespread now than ever due to the emergence of powerful open source tools, the ubiquity of accessible learning materials, and the availability of valuable data. While these resources lower the barrier to getting started, making the transition from the well-behaved datasets and tasks presented in introductory tutorials to the ill-defined problems of production machine learning is often a challenging “exercise left to the reader.”

At the intersection of DevOps and data science, this training provides data engineers and machine learners with a practical introduction to the Ray framework using Python. We walk through the process of scaling up typical machine learning workflows to the demands of real-world problems. Additionally, we cover best practices for deploying and monitoring Ray applications.
